# EquiNVDA Protocol

A DeFi synthetic asset protocol that allows users to mint, trade, and redeem synthetic NVDA tokens that track NVIDIA's real-world stock price using ETH as collateral and Chainlink price feeds.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **EquiAsset.sol** - ERC20 token contract representing synthetic NVDA tokens (EquiNVDA)
2. **EquiVault.sol** - Main vault contract managing ETH collateral, minting, redemption, and liquidation
3. **ChainlinkOracle.sol** - Oracle integration with Chainlink NVDA/USD price feed with fallback mock mode

### Key Features

- **Collateral Token**: ETH
- **Minimum Collateral Ratio**: 150% (15000 basis points)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: 130% (13000 basis points)
- **Liquidation Penalty**: 10% (1000 basis points)
- **Real-time Price Feeds**: Chainlink NVDA/USD and ETH/USD aggregators
- **Fallback Oracle**: Mock price mode for testing when Chainlink feeds are unavailable

## üîß Core Logic

### Collateralization System

The protocol maintains a minimum collateralization ratio of 150%, meaning users must provide at least $1.50 worth of ETH collateral for every $1.00 of EquiNVDA tokens they want to mint.

### Liquidation Mechanism

When a user's collateral ratio drops below 130%, their position becomes liquidatable. Liquidators can repay the user's debt in exchange for their collateral plus a 10% penalty.

### Price Oracle Integration

- **Primary**: Chainlink NVDA/USD price feed via AggregatorV3Interface
- **Fallback**: Mock price mode for testing and when Chainlink feeds are unavailable
- **Price Validation**: Ensures prices are positive and not stale (max 24 hours old)

## üìã Contract Functions

### EquiVault Functions

- `depositCollateral()` - Deposit ETH as collateral
- `mintEquiNVDA(uint256 amount)` - Mint EquiNVDA tokens against collateral
- `redeemCollateral(uint256 amount)` - Redeem ETH collateral
- `repayDebt(uint256 amount)` - Repay debt by burning EquiNVDA tokens
- `liquidate(address user, uint256 maxDebtToLiquidate)` - Liquidate under-collateralized positions
- `getCollateralRatio(address user)` - Get user's collateral ratio
- `getLatestPrice()` - Get current NVDA/USD price from oracle
- `getUserPosition(address user)` - Get user's position information
- `getSystemInfo()` - Get system-wide statistics

### EquiAsset Functions

- `mint(address to, uint256 amount)` - Mint tokens (vault only)
- `burn(address from, uint256 amount)` - Burn tokens (vault only)
- Standard ERC20 functions (transfer, approve, etc.)

### ChainlinkOracle Functions

- `getLatestPrice()` - Get price from Chainlink feed
- `getLatestPriceWithFallback()` - Get price with mock fallback
- `updateMockPrice(int256 newPrice)` - Update mock price (owner only)
- `setUseMockPrice(bool useMock)` - Switch between Chainlink and mock mode (owner only)

## üß™ Testing

The protocol includes comprehensive Foundry tests covering:

- ‚úÖ Successful collateral deposits
- ‚úÖ Successful minting with sufficient collateral
- ‚úÖ Minting failure with insufficient collateral
- ‚úÖ Collateral redemption
- ‚úÖ Debt repayment
- ‚úÖ Liquidation when collateral ratio drops below threshold
- ‚úÖ Oracle price fetching and fallback
- ‚úÖ Full mint ‚Üí price drop ‚Üí liquidation ‚Üí redemption flow
- ‚úÖ Collateral ratio calculations
- ‚úÖ System and user position information
- ‚úÖ Protocol fee and configuration updates
- ‚úÖ Edge cases and error conditions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Navigate to the foundry package
cd residency2/packages/foundry

# Run all tests
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test testMintEquiNVDA -vvv

# Run tests with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. Install Foundry:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd residency2/packages/foundry
forge install
```

### Compilation

```bash
forge build
```

### Example Test Sequence

1. **Setup**: Deploy contracts with mock price feeds
2. **Deposit**: User deposits 10 ETH as collateral
3. **Mint**: User mints 20 EquiNVDA tokens (requires ~7.5 ETH collateral at 150% ratio)
4. **Price Drop**: ETH price drops from $2000 to $1000
5. **Liquidation**: Position becomes liquidatable (ratio drops below 130%)
6. **Liquidate**: Liquidator repays debt and receives collateral + penalty
7. **Redeem**: User can redeem remaining collateral

## üîó Chainlink Integration

### Mainnet Addresses

- **NVDA/USD**: `0x86cF147c8C0F3D7d6e8A9d8C4d8B8A8A8A8A8A8A8` (example - use actual Chainlink address)
- **ETH/USD**: `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419` (example - use actual Chainlink address)

### Testnet Addresses

For testing, the protocol uses mock price feeds that can be configured with any address. In production, use the appropriate Chainlink aggregator addresses for your target network.
